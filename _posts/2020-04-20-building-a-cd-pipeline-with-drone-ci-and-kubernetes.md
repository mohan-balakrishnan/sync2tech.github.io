In this article, we are going to discuss what CI/CD is, the kind of problems it tries to solve, and where it stands in the DevOps paradigm. We also built a small lab where we used Jenkins, Ansible, and Kubernetes to build a Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline. In this article, we will be building a similar CD pipeline, but this time we are using Drone CI.
